# Facial Emotion Recognition Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a facial emotion recognition model. Various models with different architecture and layers are designed and trained over the dataset to detect and classify emotions from facial images using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

- **File:** `FaceEmotionRecognition.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Train and evaluate a model that recognizes different facial emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
- **Dataset:** The notebook uses a dataset of facial images categorized by emotions. Ensure the paths are replaced correctly before running the notebook.
